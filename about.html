&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Project is held by a team of Arclab, Zhejiang University, China which includes 2 Ph.D. students and 2 Master students. It's aim is to offer android devices a novel mobile security solution.</br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security issues of mobile smart devices are heavily exposed. Viruses, Trojan horses and malwares from all kinds of external attackers have caused people's attention. Traditional information security technologies are always aimed at a specific type of attacks and always lag in the update of malicious software. For ensure device security, users have to deploy all kinds of information security approaches, such as encryption, digital signature, safety audit, access control, digital certification and so on. Because of the lack of any security technology, the system may be invaded by a variant of malwares. However, deploying a security environment is very hard for common users. So they need an innovative solution which offers a secure execution environment model: <i>people can be in a secure and trusted domain when use some cirtical application (mobile banking), or access to sensitive data (SMS, contacts) and yet people shouldn't care whether current system is safety or not, actually!</i></br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mobile virtualization is such kind of solution!</strong></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile virtualization creates multiple exectuion environments in one device: a security domain contains pre-installed application for the basic functions of a mobile, such as a SMS and a mailer; The 3rd-party downloaded applications run in other domains which can never affect the base domain. We can use security domain for telephony, business office, mobile banking and so on. Also, we use common domains for browsing, gaming, movie, music, etc.</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a long time research on virtualization of ARM-Based mobile smart devices, we make a series of deep comparisons between <strong>Container</strong>, <strong>Para-virtualization</strong>, <strong>Hardware-assisted virtulization</strong>, <strong>Microkernel</strong>. This ensures us that lightweight OS-level virtualization is made for mobile devices.
